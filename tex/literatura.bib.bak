  abstract = {An investigation is conducted of two protocols belonging to the priority
	inheritance protocols class; the two are called the basic priority
	inheritance protocol and the priority ceiling protocol. Both protocols
	solve the uncontrolled priority inversion problem. The priority ceiling
	protocol solves this uncontrolled priority inversion problem particularly
	well; it reduces the worst-case task-blocking time to at most the
	duration of execution of a single critical section of a lower-priority
	task. This protocol also prevents the formation of deadlocks. Sufficient
	conditions under which a set of periodic tasks using this protocol
	may be scheduled is derived},

  abstract = {The IEEE 1149.1 boundary-scan standard (JTAG) has now been a reality

	has proved to be useful; the importance of standardized descriptions
	for the components; and some of the reasons why using boundary-scan
	is not always as delightful an experience as users would like},
